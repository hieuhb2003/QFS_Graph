       "['President Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive in Tel Aviv. They are flanked by Israel’s president and prime minister and their spouses. (Ilia Yefimovich/Getty Images) \\n \\n If public appearances by a president and first lady are political theater, first lady Melania Trump and her husband, President Trump, miiight want to work on their choreography. \\n \\n A brief moment caught on camera during the first couple’s arrival at the Tel Aviv airport appears to show the president reaching behind him for his wife’s hand — and she seemingly swatting it away. Or maybe, upon close inspection of the footage, perhaps she just missed grabbing his outstretched hand, like a trapeze artist flubbing the catch. \\n \\n Rebuffed, POTUS smooths his tie. \\n \\n The couple’s efforts at hand-holding have long fascinated White House watchers. (“Donald Trump ‘avoids holding Melania’s hand in public because he wants to look like a presidential alpha,’ says body language expert,” was the headline of a Daily Mail story from February.) Others tagged videos of the botched attempt at hand-holding with the hashtag #FreeMelania. \\n \\n This latest bit of awkwardness, even if it was just a meaningless goof, is likely to just give such narratives, uh, legs. ',\n",
       " ' There was no husband-wife hand-holding as President Donald Trump and his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, arrived Tel Aviv, Israel, on Monday, the second stop on their eight-day tour to five countries. \\n \\n As the Trumps walked away from Air Force One on the Israeli tarmac, the president was seen reaching for his wife’s hand. She then appeared to be swatting the president’s hand away. Israeli newspaper Haaretz shared a clip of the moment on Twitter, and it has since gone viral. \\n \\n Ilia Yefimovich/Getty Images \\n \\n The moment comes not long after the first lady’s verified personal Twitter account liked a tweet about her dramatic change in facial expressions at the inauguration when she smiled, then scowled, after the president glanced in her direction. In his anti-Trump tweet, writer Andy Ostroy joked: “Seems the only #Wall @realDonaldTrump‘s built is the one between him and @FLOTUS #Melania #trump.” \\n \\n The tweet was un-liked after Twitter caught on, and Melania’s communications director, Stephanie Grisham, later told PEOPLE “The First Lady wasn’t aware of any of this until I brought it to her attention. It isn’t her primary account and we have since changed the passwords.” \\n \\n RELATED VIDEO: Exclusive: Natasha Stoynoff Speaks Out: ‘I Don’t Want Women to Feel Afraid’ \\n \\n Just ahead of the president’s overseas tour – his first foreign trip as president – the first lady announced her plans to join. \\n \\n “I am very excited for the upcoming trip,” the first lady said in a statement. “This will not just be an opportunity to support my husband as he works on important matters of national security and foreign relations, it will also be my honor to visit and speak with women and children from different countries, with different perspectives.” \\n \\n After arriving in Israel, Monday, Trump became the first president to visit the Western Wall, reported CNN. \\n \\n The first lady and Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, also prayed at the wall. ',\n",
       " ' Maybe Melania Trump, a woman who was once photographed for Vanity Fair forking a bowl of expensive necklaces as though they were spaghetti noodles, has more in common with the average American than we initially thought. Like the average American, it appears that she too, cannot stand her husband. \\n \\n This afternoon in Tel Aviv, President Donald Trump reached for his wife’s hand. Rather than indulge him with human touch, the sort of human touch regular married people who like each other might engage in, the reluctant First Lady swatted his hand away. This wasn’t done backstage before an event, or in the privacy of a place where it was safe to assume there weren’t any cameras. No, Melania has grown bolder in her push to telegraph her disdain for Donald. She did it as she and her husband joined Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife in a photo op. She did it in front of a veritable United Nations of news cameras. She did it so the whole world could see. She doesn’t care if he’s embarrassed, and it completely rules. \\n \\n And the whole world did see; within minutes, the moment had gone viral. With that swat, Melania had temporarily sated the public’s bottomless appetite to see President Trump denied what he wants in its most viscerally appealing manifestation. Trump wanted his wife to accept him, to join him in acting like a normal human couple for the cameras instead of an orb-fondling wannabe despot. Seeing tweets about a judge striking down an immigration ban, or watching a Trump surrogate make an ass of themselves on cable news just doesn’t taste as delicious to a victory-starved liberal as the image of a woman slapping Trump’s hand away. For the millions who continue to be horrified by the Trump era, there’s nothing more zeitgeisty in 2017 than Trump schadenfreude porn. And there’s nobody more well-positioned to deliver it than our Ice Queen First Lady. \\n \\n This isn’t the first time Melania has denied Donald’s undersized hands the pleasure of human touch. In January, when the couple arrived in Washington for his inauguration, Donald tried to hold his wife’s hand just before completing the very scary task of going down a flight of stairs. Melania was not having it. \\n \\n That move kicked off an inauguration weekend that, told from Melania’s perspective, would read like a novel about a tragically trapped princess, or a live-action Pepe Le Pew cartoon starring Melania as the cat. When the couple danced, Melania leaned away rigidly. In every public appearance, the impeccably dressed First Lady wore a veil of despair. Her husband often seemed to forget that she existed. When they kissed, they did not touch. Melania acted like a mascot of left-wing despair. \\n \\n In the ensuing weeks, Melania’s public disdain for her husband only intensified. An US Weekly cover story declared that she was “secretly miserable” as First Lady, an account I must dispute since it’s always been obvious that she’s miserable. She skipped out on typical first lady duties when the prime minister of Japan visited. And a couple of weeks ago, whoever manages her verified Twitter account favorited a Tweet about how alienated the Trumps seem from each other. \\n \\n All of this is occurring as Trump’s daughter Ivanka performs most of the non-romantic duties of First Lady, delivering speeches and posing for photos. In recent interviews, Ivanka’s even started putting on a strange Jackie O affect. If I were Melania, I’d find the whole thing irksome. \\n \\n Critics will point out that Melania, of course, is no hero, and no saint. She’s the one who married Donald, and she can leave whenever she gets sick of living in a golden box in the sky and feeling sorry for herself. There are plenty of women whose lives are much more worse off thanks to the president, and plenty more whose lives would be worse off if not for the saving grace of checks and balances. But her public acting out provides a nice bit of levity for a time that often feels devoid of it; a lot of women would love the opportunity to swat Trump’s hand away. \\n \\n Melania’s swats also serve to expose another Trump lie: when you’re a star, they don’t always let you do it. ',\n",
       " \" First Lady Melania Trump had another awkward hand-holding moment with husband Donald Trump on Tuesday as the first couple welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, to the White House for the Trump administration’s first state visit. \\n \\n In footage captured by MSNBC and later dissected by Twitter users, Trump appears to make a subtle effort to hold his wife’s hand, first extending his pinky finger and then gently giving her hand a little shake before she finally places her hand his. \\n \\n This isn’t the first time Mrs. Trump has appeared reluctant to hold her husband’s hand. In May, the first lady was caught on camera clearly swatting away her husband’s hand during a trip to Tel Aviv, Israel. Then in February, as the first lady and president departed the White House for a trip to Ohio, Trump once again tried but failed to make hand-to-hand contact with his wife. \\n \\n On Tuesday, Twitter took note of the Trumps’ latest awkward hand-holding moment. \\n \\n That moment when your wife resists holding your hand… PRICELESS. 🤣🤣 @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/hDpPddTv5C — BetsyBits (@BetsyBits) April 24, 2018 \\n \\n Trump attempts to hold Melania's hand at President Emmanuel Macron's arrival at the South Lawn: pic.twitter.com/NlBlcdZ29s — Braxton (@braxtonryn) April 24, 2018 \\n \\n Look at poor #Melania right hand trying to tell #Trump that he didn’t dig deep enough. — Sam (@SamMusaed) April 24, 2018 \\n \\n Trump's attempt to hold Melania's hand is EVERYTHING: pic.twitter.com/t7yqNGpJym — Braxton (@braxtonryn) April 24, 2018 \\n \\n Poor Melania, she loomed like she was holding back tears under her hat as she held Trump's hand — Daring Reporter (@DaringReporter) April 24, 2018 \\n \\n “Look at poor #Melania right hand trying to tell #Trump that he didn’t dig deep enough,” one tweeter joked. \\n \\n “Poor Melania, she looked like she was holding back tears under her hat as she held Trump’s hand,” said another. \\n \\n The first lady’s white, wide-brimmed hat was also lighting up Twitter on Tuesday. \\n \\n JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty \\n \\n The striking accessory stole the show as Mrs. Trump and French First Lady Brigitte Macron — both in white skirt suits — joined their husbands on the White House South Lawn for a military welcome ceremony. The first lady’s white suit is from the Michael Kors Collection and costs $2,195, according to CNN. The outlet said the hat was also from the Michael Kors Collection hat, but a new pool report says it seems that “Michael Kors is not taking credit for the hat.” \\n \\n On Twitter, people compared the first lady’s hat look to those worn by Beyoncé in her “Formation” music video, Jude Law in The Young Pope and Kerry Washington in Scandal. \\n \\n Melania with the Young Pope hat pic.twitter.com/PqwI4bqO9A — Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) April 24, 2018 \\n \\n How did Melania get Fanucci's hat? pic.twitter.com/ZFZJwazkYm — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) April 24, 2018 \\n \\n Is Melania Trump’s white hat a symbol of morality like Olivia Pope’s? pic.twitter.com/JZRHL7iuOi — KOlive (@kmomonahan) April 24, 2018 \\n \\n Others noticed that while Brigitte Macron managed to expertly kiss both of her fellow first lady’s cheeks beneath the wide brim, President Trump had trouble making contact and settled on air kisses instead. \\n \\n Hats off to Brigitte Macron, who just managed a flawless French two-cheek kiss under and around Melania Trump's enormous flat-brim hat.

He’s brash and abrasive and arrogant. He often talks before thinking; is insensitive to others; doesn’t care for political correctness or for the sensitivities of minorities; believes that might makes right; detests international organizations and multilateralism, and doesn’t think much of Europe either. \\n \\n The only trait Trump is showing that might jar with Israelis is his repeated insistence, amplified in Jerusalem, that peace is attainable and that he is the agent of its achievement. It is a declaration that was seen as naive and messianic and vaguely anti-Israeli when Obama dared make it, so it perplexes Israelis to hear Trump promote peace as a realistic option.

But an informal exchange between the American and Israeli leaders and their spouses, caught on camera after the welcoming ceremony at Ben Gurion International Airport, said a lot about how she and her husband view the media – and themselves. \\n \\n “Also us, the press hates and the public loves,” she confided in Melania Trump, the first lady of the United States.

Donald Trump\\'s visit to Israel: Eight must-read opinions \\n \\n U.S. President Donald Trump\\'s trip to Israel has been met with both excitement and trepidation, and has everyone speculating about he will do and what he should try to achieve during his visit. Here are eight must-read opinions from Haaretz\\'s writers. \\n \\n 9:33 A.M. The explosive history of the Jerusalem hotel hosting Trump \\n \\n It could never be confused with a Trump property: It lacks the glitz and the gold plating, not to mention the height. But there was never any doubt that when he pulled into Jerusalem on Monday, Donald Trump would be lodging at the King David Hotel. Even as the competition for the dollars of luxury travelers increases – with the addition just during the past decade of both the Mamilla Hotel and the Waldorf Astoria, both within walking distance of the 87-year-old King David – it’s still clear that the latter is the capital’s premier hostelry. (David B. Green) \\n \\n 9:21 A.M. Who\\'s behind the dozens of pro-Trump billboards around Jerusalem? \\n \\n When Trump arrives in Jerusalem, huge billboards proclaiming “Trump is a Friend of Zion” and requesting “Trump Make Israel Great” will greet him. \\n \\n It will be hard for the American leader to avoid them. Altogether, 42 billboards featuring intertwined Israeli and American flags have been erected around the city at a total cost of $100,000. \\n \\n So who’s behind this big campaign? The billboards bear the name Friends of Zion Museum in Jerusalem, but in fact, the initiative is really the brainchild of one man – Mike Evans, the founder of this institution and among the first Christian evangelical leaders to declare his support for Trump\\'s presidential run. (Judy Maltz) \\n \\n 9:19 A.M. In Bethlehem, Palestinians confident Trump\\'s one-hour visit \\'won\\'t change anything\\' \\n \\n Like the Palestinian government, which has been positively surprised by some recent statements from the Trump administration, social activists have also taken a relatively positive view of the visit. Nimala Kharoufeh, a member of the Fatah youth movement and the founder of nearby Beit Jala’s Beit Ashams community center, focused on comments that have raised some hopes locally, such as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s mention of the importance of Palestinian self-determination. However, her take following the speech is “unchanged,” she said. “I feel really positive, not that I have high expectations, but I’m positive about this visit. Not moving this embassy to Jerusalem is another positive step, so nothing in the speech changed my position.” (Noga Tarnopolsky, Bethlehem) \\n \\n 9:15 A.M. Jerusalem braces for Trump\\'s visit \\n \\n The hospitality sector in Israel has geared up for the arrival on Monday of U.S. President Donald Trump and his sizeable entourage, as well as the press corps coming to cover the visit. \\n \\n The Israel Airports Authority has asked people using Ben-Gurion International Airport around midday on Monday and Tuesday afternoon, when he will be departing, to get to the airport early and be in touch with their airlines regarding possible changes in flight times. \\n \\n International flights on low-cost carriers that normally use Terminal 1 are being transferred to Terminal 3 until early Wednesday morning. Domestic flights from the airport to Eilat will operate normally. Trump’s presence will also be disrupting highway traffic and security will be particularly tight. (Gili Melnitcki) \\n \\n 9:14 A.M. Harness Trump’s determination to attain the ultimate Middle East deal \\n \\n If the Israeli government truly seeks peace as it claims, it must harness Trump’s determination in order to bravely draft its path to a diplomatic solution. The Israeli right is torn between the annexationist wing and the wing that believes the only solution is the division of the country one way or another. Those who oppose annexation, most of the nation, must take advantage of Trump’s special temperament by joining together to say no to the annexationist right and opening a new chapter in the Middle East. (Haaretz Editorial) \\n \\n 9:09 A.M. As Trump leaves Saudis for Israel and Palestinians, Kushner moves center stage \\n \\n The visit to Israel and the Palestinian Authority could be the perfect opportunity for Jared Kushner to take the stage and increase his involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian file. But in order for that to happen, the president\\'s arguably closest adviser will need to find time in an increasingly packed schedule, a schedule that could become even tighter if the recent rumors and allegations connecting him to the investigation into Trump\\'s ties with Russia turn out to be true. (Amir Tibon) \\n \\n 9:03 A.M. After Riyadh speech, Trump comes to Israel as a messianic opportunist \\n \\n Donald Trump changed America’s standing in the Middle East on Sunday, perhaps historically. He reversed eight years of foreign policy carried out by his predecessor, Barack Obama. He positioned himself as champion of Saudi Arabia and Sunni Islam and as chief adversary of Iran and the Shia. He embraced the kingdoms, sheikdoms, dictatorships, military regimes and popular democratic republics of political Islam and absolved them of the human rights and democratic mumbo-jumbo that Obama used to torment them with. Like Benjamin Netanyahu before him, Trump is now Mr. Terror, a leader for whom all other considerations are subordinate to the fight against it. (Chemi Shalev) \\n \\n 9:00 A.M. Israel isn’t a bling nation that can impress Trump. And that’s a good thing \\n \\n It’s usually easy for Israel to put on a good show for the intelligent statesman on his first visit. For a start, they can take him to one of the high-tech hubs and present a few snazzy start-ups. There’s even one right next to the makeshift helipad at First Station. But one can imagine Trump’s eyes glazing over minutes into the explanation of any cutting-edge innovation. Even the sums of money made in high-tech exits are unlikely to impress an old-fashioned businessman who made (and lost) billions through tangible real estate and glitzy branding. Just the very idea of making a profit out of ideas is alien. The closest he ever got to selling ideas was the Trump University scam. (Anshel Pfeffer) \\n \\n 8:58 A.M. Trump plans to shower Israel with love, but it might be a honey trap for Netanyahu \\n \\n The visit to Jerusalem is important to both Trump and Netanyahu for the same reason. Both want to show that the tensions that characterized the U.S.-Israeli relationship during Barack Obama’s eight years in office are over. Both want the public parts of the visit to be full of symbolic gestures, photo-ops and expressions of incredible friendship, that will leave no doubt as to the state of bilateral relations – the complete opposite of the Obama era. \\n \\n But the love with which Trump will envelope Netanyahu during the visit could turn out to be a honey trap for the premier. Netanyahu could find hints of this during Trump’s speech in Saudi Arabia, which he delivered just as the security cabinet was being convened to approve a package of economic concessions for the Palestinians. If Netanyahu had left the security cabinet meeting to watch Trump’s speech he would have been delighted. (Barak Ravid) \\n \\n 8:30 A.M. - Fuming Netanyahu orders ministers to attend Trump\\'s reception after most refuse to show up \\n \\n Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has required all cabinet ministers to attend the reception ceremony for U.S. President Donald Trump at Ben-Gurion International Airport on Monday. A senior Israeli official said that Netanyahu issued his instructions after finding out that most ministers were not planning on attending the event. \\n \\n During a Sunday meeting of coalition heads, Netanyahu was notified that there would be a sparse attendance of ministers at the reception and that most party heads wouldn\\'t participate in it. Netanyahu was furious and blew up the meeting, a senior official who attended the meeting said. Immediately afterwards, the Prime Minister\\'s Bureau issued an instruction to all government ministers according to which they must participate in the airport reception. (Barak Ravid) \\n \\n 7:00 A.M. - Behind the Scenes of the Trump Administration\\'s Tug-of-war Over the Israel Embassy Move \\n \\n Keep the embassy in Tel Aviv or move it to Jerusalem? The issue has turned into a fierce struggle between Trump\\'s advisers and his top cabinet members. He has until June 1 to decide. Barak Ravid has all the inside information. \\n \\n 6:45 A.M. - These are the voices whispering in Trump’s ear about Israel and how to make the \\'ultimate deal\\' \\n \\n Lacking a clear and consistent policy to go on, many observers are looking for clues by examining what the president’s advisers on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process are calling for. And while most U.S. administrations in recent decades have housed different schools of thought, the diverse range of opinions in the Trump administration seems truly extraordinary. \\n \\n So who are the people advising the 45th president on Israel, and what are they telling him? Here’s a list from both inside and outside the administration. ',\n",

And I feel they choosing the politics over helping others. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Can you give me any examples? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I would not talk about it. They know who they are. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: What would you say is the toughest part about being first lady? \\n \\n MELANIA: Sometimes it\\'s, you know, losing the privacy, that\\'s maybe the part that you always under the microscope. And I cannot freely move anymore. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Give me an example of something that you could do before that now you can\\'t do because you are first lady, as far as just everyday kind of living. \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Well, before I could easily move, like, in a minute I could go somewhere. Now it\\'s bigger production. You need to, wherever you go it\\'s a big, big production. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: You know, our first, first lady, Martha Washington, famously said the role of first lady can sometimes feel like a state prisoner. Can you relate to that? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I don\\'t feel like a prisoner. No. I enjoying it, and this will not last forever.

Because I believe that we need to be very vigilant who is coming to the country. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: But do you think people should be able to bring in their mother and their father? \\n \\n Melania Trump: Yes, of course. But they -- we need to -- we need to vet them. We need to know who they are. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: Have you told your husband this? \\n \\n Melania Trump: Yes, of course. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: And what does he say? \\n \\n Melania Trump: He agrees. \\n \\n But if that’s the case -- that’s something the president has never publicly outlined: \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF DONALD TRUMP] \\n \\n Tom Llamas: It sounds like what your husband says on immigration to the crowds, on Twitter, is different than the conversations you and him have. How do you sort of reconcile that? \\n \\n Melania Trump: I don\\'t -- I don\\'t think so. I think he believes the same. That chain migration, he doesn\\'t want to just cut it off completely. We need to vet the people, and we need to make sure that they believe in our system. \\n \\n The White House didn’t respond to our request to confirm whether the President’s ban on chain migration excludes parents. \\n \\n But it was with an immigration issue that Melania Trump found her strongest voice -- taking on her own husband over his controversial policy of separating families crossing the border illegally. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF DONALD TRUMP] \\n \\n Tom Llamas: So as the family separation was happening, was there an image or a moment for you that just drew the line that you said, \"I have to get involved\"? \\n \\n Melania Trump: I saw it on the news, and I reacted right away. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: Was it the kids in the cages? We interviewed mothers who were crying, saying they\\'d been separated for eight months from their children. \\n \\n Melania Trump: Separation, yes. It was unacceptable for me to see children and parents separated. It was heartbreaking. And I reacted with my own voice. I went to the border and met with the Border Patrol. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP] \\n \\n Chris Christie: Everybody was talking about it, but she actually got on a plane and went and she wanted to see for herself. Again, because I think there are moments when she believes that she can best explain things to the President. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF MELANIA TRUMP] \\n \\n Tom Llamas: What did you learn at the border? \\n \\n Melania Trump: I met with the Border Patrol agents, and they doing a great job. And after my trip, I ask them how I can help to reunite the children and parents. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: What would your message be to those families that are still separated? There are hundreds of kids that are -- that are still not with their parents. What would you tell them? \\n \\n Melania Trump: I would tell them to keep strong and that -- time will come. It -- everything needs to go through the court system. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: You know, it was under your husband\\'s policy, the zero-tolerance policy, that these families were separated. That enforcement. Is this somewhere where you disagreed with him? \\n \\n Melania Trump: Yes, and I let him know. I didn\\'t know that that policy will come out. I was blindsided by it. I told him at home. And I said to him that I feel that\\'s unacceptable. And he felt the same. \\n \\n One of the rare times President Trump has changed course on an issue – putting a stop to family separations \\n \\n Cecilia Vega: This is certainly not a president who likes to reverse course when it comes to an issue. So if the first lady is the one to convince him to end this family separations policy it really speaks to what a strong advisor she is in his inner circle. \\n \\n But it was during that first trip to the border that the First Lady’s concern for those separated families was called into question – all because of that now infamous jacket. \\n \\n [GOOD MORNING AMERICA NEWS CLIP] \\n \\n Anita McBride: It really mattered a lot when she wore that jacket with those words on the back of it that nobody could really understand. That was so uncharacteristic really, because she doesn\\'t appear to be an uncaring or unfeeling person. \\n \\n Cecilia Vega: The letters right there in large font, the first lady fully aware of the cameras and the eyes of the world watching. \\n \\n The rampant speculation only fueled after the first lady’s communications director insisted there was no hidden message behind the jacket. \\n \\n [TV CLIP] \\n \\n Tom Llamas: Let’s talk about the jacket. \\n \\n Melania Trump: The jacket. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: Why did you wear it? \\n \\n Melania Trump: You know, I often asking myself, if I would not wear that jacket, if I will have so much media coverage. And it\\'s obvious I didn\\'t wear the jacket for the children. I wore the jacket to go on the plane and off the plane. And it was for the people and for the left-wing media who are criticizing me. And I wanna show them that I don\\'t care. You could criticize whatever you wanna say, but it will not stop me to do what I feel is right. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: What was it that compelled you to wear that at that moment? Because you were down there, you had just been with children and then you put the jacket on. \\n \\n Melania Trump: I didn’t have a jacket when I was with the children After the visit I put it back on because I see how media got obsessed about it. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: Your office had to release a statement during this time saying the jacket is just a jacket. So you were sending a message with the jacket? \\n \\n Melania Trump: It-- it was kind of a message, yes. I would prefer that they would focus on what I do and on my initiatives than what I wear. \\n \\n Coming up – Melania Trump and MeToo -- and for the first time -- she addresses questions about her husband’s alleged affairs and the personal storm that hit the White House. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: Has your husband apologized to you since you\\'ve been in the White House? \\n \\n Stay tuned. \\n \\n Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images \\n \\n Act 4: \\n \\n Play \\n \\n AS THE FIRST LADY STEPPED OFF THE PLANE ON THE SECOND LEG OF HER AFRICA VISIT, \\n \\n THOUSAND OF MILES AWAY, HER HUSBAND HAD JUST MADE HEADLINES IN THE BITTER DEBATE OVER THE CREDIBILITY OF DOCTOR CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WHO WAS AT THE CENTER OF THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF DONALD TRUMP] \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Can women in the #MeToo movement call you a supporter? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Women, they have always my support. I feel that women and men -- they should be heard. And we should all be treated equal. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: What is your take about the #MeToo movement, though? Do you believe in them? Do you support the #MeToo movement? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I support the women, and they need to be heard. And you know, also men, not just women. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: So when you say that, though, some people may -- may interpret that to mean that -- that you don\\'t fully support the #MeToo movement, or -- or they go too far. Has the #MeToo movement gone too far? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: In certain times, yes. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Can you give me an example? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Well, if somebody\\'s accused -- with -- stuff that is not -- it\\'s not correct that somebody accused of somebody as they say, \"You\\'re guilty before you innocent,\" right? And -- I don\\'t believe in that. \\n \\n BUT FOR HER HUSBAND AND STEPSON, DON JR., IT IS MEN -- NOT THE WOMEN -- WHO HAVE MORE TO FEAR FROM THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF DONALD TRUMP] \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF DONALD TRUMP, JR.] \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Your son-in-law this past week said at this point in time he\\'s more concerned for his sons than his daughters. Your husband has agreed with him. Where do you stand? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I think we need to be concerned for -- for all of them. Not just boys or girls. I think for all of them. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Is this sort of a tough conversation you\\'ll eventually have, you think, with your son? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I teach my son to be respectful and responsible, And I have a conversation with him already. He\\'s 12 and a half. And I think it\\'s very important, especially the world changed so much. \\n \\n THAT WORLD HAS CHANGED FOR MELANIA TRUMP AS WELL. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP] \\n \\n OVER A DOZEN WOMEN HAVE ACCUSED PRESIDENT TRUMP OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WHICH HE DENIES. \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: They were -- they were lies. And as I said before, all the accusations, they should -- be handled in a court of law. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Do you think men in the -- in the news that have been accused of -- of sexual assault, sexual harassment, have been treated unfairly? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Well, you need to have evidence. You need to have really hard evidence that, you know, that if you accuse of something, show the evidence. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Some women might hear that and say, \"How could you say that, Mrs. Trump? You need to stand with women.\" What would you say? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I do stand with women. But we need to show the evidence. \\n \\n BUT THIS PAST YEAR, A NEW SCANDAL BROKE THAT PLACED HER MARRIAGE UNDER THE WHITE HOT SCRUTINY OF THE PRESS ONCE AGAIN. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP] \\n \\n WHEN THE NEWS BROKE JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION ABOUT PORN STAR STORMY DANIELS BEING PAID BY THE PRESIDENT’S PERSONAL ATTORNEY MICHAEL COHEN, TO STAY SILENT ABOUT THE ALLEGED AFFAIR, THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE FIRST LADY. \\n \\n Cokie Roberts: There were lots of rumors that she was furious after the Stormy Daniels story became public. And she wasn\\'t seen in public for good while after that. \\n \\n THOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE DENIED THE PRESIDENT HAD AN AFFAIR, MELANIA TRUMP CANCELLED PLANS TO TRAVEL WITH HER HUSBAND TO THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM IN DAVOS. THEN ARRIVED AT THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS SEPARATELY. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP] \\n \\n ALL THIS RAISING SPECULATION ABOUT THE STATE OF THE FIRST COUPLE’S MARRIAGE. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: You did agree to this interview, to your credit, with no preconditions. \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Correct. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Knowing that there could be some tough questions asked. You\\'re not the first, first lady to have to deal with her husband\\'s alleged infidelities. Has this put a strain on your marriage? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: It is not concern and focus of mine. I\\'m a mother and a first lady, and I have much more important things to think about and to do. I know people like to speculate and media like to speculate about our marriage. And circulate the gossip. But I understand the gossip sells newspapers, magazines, getting advertisers. And unfortunately we live -- in this kind of world today. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Have you been hurt, though? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Media what is speculating. Yeah, it\\'s not always pleasant, of course. But -- I know what is right and what is wrong and what is true or not true. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: A lot of people are gonna be watching this across the country, wondering how you have dealt with all this. There\\'s a human equation to this. So what\\'s in your heart? How do you deal with this? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I\\'m very strong, and I know what my priorities are. \\n \\n AT FIRST THE PRESIDENT DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT A PAYMENT TO STORMY DANIELS. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF DONALD TRUMP] \\n \\n BUT ONE MONTH LATER… HE FINALLY ADMITTED KNOWING ABOUT THE PAYOFF. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP] \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF RUDY GIULIANI] \\n \\n THE NEXT DAY ... THIS STATEMENT FROM THE FIRST LADY’S SPOKESPERSON “I DON’T BELIEVE MRS. TRUMP HAS EVER DISCUSSED HER THOUGHTS ON ANYTHING WITH MR. GIULIANI.” \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: The only time you have commented publicly, your office, was when Rudy Giuliani came out and said your thoughts about Stormy Daniels\\' claims, and said, \"She believes in her husband. She knows it\\'s not true.\" Is that an accurate statement? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I never talked to Mr. Giuliani. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Why do you think he came out and said that? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I don\\'t know. You need to ask him. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP] \\n \\n IT’S NOT THE FIRST TIME QUESTIONS HAVE ARISEN ABOUT HOW MELANIA TRUMP WOULD REACT TO SCANDALOUS REPORTS. \\n \\n JUST A MONTH BEFORE THE ELECTION, THIS JAW DROPPING TAPE BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND TV HOST BILLY BUSH, WAS LEAKED TO THE WASHINGTON POST. \\n \\n [VIDEO CLIP] \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP] \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: During the \"Access Hollywood\" incident during the campaign, your husband apologized to you. Has your husband apologized to you since you\\'ve been in the White House? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Yeah, he apologized. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Can you tell us what he apologized about? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: You know, I know I\\'m the first lady, but I\\'m also a mother and a wife. So I will keep some private thoughts for myself. So, we\\'ll leave it at that. \\n \\n THEN, JUST YESTERDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE HAD THIS CLARIFICATION: “THE PRESIDENT OFTEN APOLOGIZES TO MRS. TRUMP FOR ALL THE MEDIA NONSENSE AND SCRUTINY SHE HAS BEEN UNDER SINCE ENTERING THE WHITE HOUSE.” \\n \\n NEXT \\n \\n WHOS’S IN, WHO’S OUT. AND DID MELANIA HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT? \\n \\n TOM LAMAS: Has he had people that you didn’t trust working for him? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Yes. \\n \\n PLUS, SECRET SIGNALS? FROM INSIDE THE MOST SCRUTINIZED MARRIAGE ON THE PLANET. \\n \\n Cecilia Vega: Is she speaking to the president? Is she speaking to the media? \\n \\n Llamas: When we return. \\n \\n Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images \\n \\n Act 5: \\n \\n Play \\n \\n Across Africa, we witnessed a First Lady seeming to campaign for a more compassionate role for America around the world -- from meeting new mothers in Ghana to dancing with orphans in Kenya. \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I think it is a very important that we show the world that America cares. That this administration cares and I care. When other people have more opportunities then the world is freer. \\n \\n But that message seems in stark contrast to the Trump doctrine: \\n \\n [CLIP OF DONALD TRUMP AT THE UNITED NATIONS] \\n \\n Cecilia Vega: \"America first\" is the name of the game for this administration and President Trump proposed limiting U.S. aid by 40 percent, but Congress did not approve that. \\n \\n One of the targets of the President’s proposed cuts – an agency whose work the First Lady highlighted while in Africa -- the US Agency for International Development. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Your husband has wanted to slash the funding for USAID, do you agree with that? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Well they’re looking into it. USAID, it’s helping the countries for self-reliance and it will take a long time. We still need to help them but we will see. It’s still in the open stages. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: What will you tell president Trump about USAID and the work they are doing here in Africa? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I will give him my feedback. What I saw and what I learned. \\n \\n And those close to him say that if anyone can get the famously stubborn President to change his mind on an issue – it’s his own wife. \\n \\n Chris Christie: She\\'s the most powerful ally you can get if you\\'re attempting to influence Donald Trump. No one, I know him for a long time, no one influences Donald Trump more than Melania Trump. Nobody. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: One of the president’s closest friends, Tom Barrack, Jr. told Vanity Fair, \"The one who has the most control over Donald Trump is Melania, 100 percent.\" Is that true? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Oh, I wish. I give him my honest advice and honest opinions. And then he does what he wants to do. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Sources have told us, sources in the White House, that you are the gatekeeper. That you tell him who he can trust and who he can\\'t trust. Is that true? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Yes, I give him my honest advice. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: He\\'s been in office now almost two years. Has he had people that you didn\\'t trust working for him? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Yes. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Did you let him know? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I let him know. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: And what did he do? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Well, some people, they don\\'t work there anymore. \\n \\n In fact -- the Trump White House is notorious for its swiftly revolving door -- \\n \\n [NEWS CLIPS] \\n \\n At this point in the President’s term, more people have left than in any administration in history. It’s even been dubbed: “Survivor: the White House Edition” \\n \\n Cecilia Vega: This administration has struggled to keep people inside the West Wing, partly because it’s just so chaotic there. \\n \\n Jon Karl: It’s a very tough environment because you always have to figure out where the president is gonna be and you could be thrown off course at any minute \\n \\n And even the loyalty of those remaining in the White House was cast in doubt after that bombshell New York Times op-ed. In it, an anonymous senior administration official claimed there was a “quiet resistance” among staffers opposing the president. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Do you think there\\'s still people there that he can\\'t trust? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Yes. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Still working now? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Yes. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: How hard do you think it is for him to be president, knowing that there\\'s also that contingent of people that are close to him? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Well, it\\'s harder to governor -- governing. It\\'s -- you know, you always need to watch your back. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF DONALD TRUMP] \\n \\n But with all of that infighting, backstabbing and intrigue -- we wondered if the first lady had any qualms about sticking around the White House for a possible second term. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Your husband most likely will run for re-election. Are you looking forward to possibly six more years in the White House? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: I believe that my husband is doing an incredible job for this nation. And I want that American people have a success. So whatever he will decide, I will support him. \\n \\n Tom Llamas: But are you looking forward to it? \\n \\n Melania Trump: I\\'m enjoying it. I really love to live in the Washington and in the White House. \\n \\n The first lady may love living in the White House -- but we still had one more question -- what about her feelings for the man living there with her? \\n \\n Tom Llamas: You mentioned you still have a good marriage. Do you love your husband? \\n \\n When we return. \\n \\n Yuri Gripas/EPA via Shutterstock, FILE \\n \\n Act 6: \\n \\n Play \\n \\n RIGHT NOW, NO MARRIAGE ON THE PLANET…MORE TALKED ABOUT, GOSSIPED ABOUT, WHISPERED ABOUT THAN THEIRS. ON THE PUBLIC STAGE ... IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS, HE IS THE PROUD HUSBAND. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF DONALD TRUMP] \\n \\n AND FOR YEARS, SHE -- ADORING HIM. \\n \\n [NEWS CLIP OF MELANIA TRUMP] \\n \\n BUT UNDER THE GLARE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOTLIGHT…PHOTOS AND MOMENTS EMERGING…NOT IN LINE WITH THE IMAGE OF AN IDEAL MARRIAGE. \\n \\n [ENTERTAINMENT SHOW CLIP] \\n \\n JON KARL: People try to scrutinize every little movement, did she swat away his hands. \\n \\n CECILIA VEGA: People play this guessing game about is she speaking to the president, is she speaking to the media, is this some kind of subliminal message. Part of that is because we don’t hear a lot from her. \\n \\n CHRIS CHRISTIE: I think it\\'s a misunderstood marriage from the outside. I see them together frequently, and there\\'s real affection and there\\'s real respect there. \\n \\n TERRY MORAN: For people who like President Trump, she is a great, elegant asset to him and to the country. She\\'s a great first lady. For people who don\\'t like President Trump, she is either the beauty who lives with the beast, or the princess trapped in the castle with the dragon, or the arm candy on the billionaire. \\n \\n SO WE ASKED MELANIA TRUMP HERSELF FOR THE FINAL ANSWER. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: You mentioned you still have a good marriage. Do you love your husband? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Yes, we are fine. Yes. It\\'s what media speculate, and it\\'s gossip. It\\'s not always correct stuff. \\n \\n THE MYSTERY OF THE NATION’S MOST SCRUTINIZED MARRIAGE, NOT QUITE SOLVED. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Knowing what you do now, what advice would you have given yourself on Jan. 20, 2017? \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Listen yourself the way you always listen yourself. I always ask myself what is my priority. What I wanna do. What is good for our child and for me and for my husband. And I took those steps. \\n \\n TOM LLAMAS: Thank you, Mrs. Trump. \\n \\n MELANIA TRUMP: Thank you.']"

USA TODAY \\n \\n Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico, California, in making Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.) \\n \\n The deadliest fire in California history has set into motion the largest charitable collaboration ever among the nation\\'s breweries, as more than 1,200 have signed on to brew a beer to raise funds for those affected by the Camp Fire in Northern California. \\n \\n Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., which is located in Chico, California, part of Butte County but west of the areas hardest hit by the fire, fed first responders and displaced residents during the fire and handed out clothing, too. \\n \\n But Ken Grossman, who founded the brewery in 1980, wanted to do more. He decided to brew a special beer, Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, and donate all the proceeds to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund, which it seeded with a $100,000 donation. \\n \\n Then, Grossman asked other breweries across the U.S. to join in. \"We are working with malt, hop and yeast suppliers to provide raw ingredient donations to all participating breweries and are asking those breweries to donate 100 percent of their sales to the fund, as well,\" he said in the letter, a copy of which is posted online. \\n \\n \"We know that the rebuilding process will take time, but we’re in this for the long haul,\" Grossman said. \"Our hope is to get Resilience IPA in taprooms all over the country to create a solid start for our community’s future.\" \\n \\n More: Paradise fire survivor: \\'This was my home before, and I want it to be again\\' \\n \\n More: Colossal California wildfire finally contained; grim search for bodies continues \\n \\n Collaboration is common among independent brewers, and so is the brewing of charity beers. But the response to Sierra Nevada\\'s Camp Fire initiative has been historic. \"I’m quite sure that it’s both the largest-ever collaboration and the biggest industry charity ever,\" said Garrett Oliver, brewmaster at Brooklyn Brewery. \\n \\n So far, more than 1,000 breweries have pledged to make their own batches of Resilience Butte County Proud IPA. \"This is a great idea spearheaded by a great indie craft brewing pioneer supporting a great cause,\" said Sam Calagione, co-founder of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Delaware, which brewed its batch of Resilience IPA and plans to serve it in late December. \\n \\n \"Our thoughts are with all of the brave folks who have helped navigate this challenging moment in Northern California and all of the families who have lost love ones,\" Calagione said. \"The craft brewing community has always been altruistic and mutually supportive, and giving back to our communities is one of the things we collectively do best.\" \\n \\n Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Delaware, is one of about 1,000 breweries joining Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in making Resilience Butte County IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery) \\n \\n Another of the participating breweries, Fort Collins, Colorado-headquartered New Belgium Brewing, recalls the hardship caused by the nearby 2012 High Park fire. The brewery\\'s paperboard manufacturer, Graphic Packaging International, is located in Oroville, California, in Butte County. \\n \\n “Many of their co-workers have tragically lost their homes, yet they’re still coming to work every day. That is the definition of resilience, and we’re happy to support recovery efforts in any way that we can,\" New Belgium Brewing CEO Steve Fechheimer said. New Belgium brewed its batch Tuesday and plans to make it available at its Fort Collins and Asheville tasting rooms in about two weeks. \\n \\n \"At New Belgium, we believe that business can be a force for good, and we think that ethos is shared throughout the craft beer community,” Fechheimer said. \\n \\n Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico, California, in making Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.) \\n \\n Sierra Nevada brewed its batch of more than 74,000 gallons on Tuesday and plans to release it Jan. 5, 2019. Sierra will can some of that beer and also make it available on draft. Other participating breweries will only sell Resilience IPA on draft, with most releases planned in late December and early January. Overall, the project should yield about 8.6 million pints of beer, the brewery estimates. \\n \\n Breweries joining include small, midsize and regional breweries nationwide as well as Anheuser-Busch-owned Goose Island Beer Co. and Miller Coors-owned Blue Moon Brewing Co.

About 15 percent of Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. employees lost their homes in the fire, as did \"countless friends and family members as well,\" she said. \\n \\n Even before the fire was officially extinguished, the brewery had set up the relief fund. \"Once the fire is out, we will distribute all donated money to partner organizations that are dedicated to rebuilding and supporting the communities that have been affected,\" Grossman said in a note on the brewery\\'s website, also signed by daughter Sierra and son Brian. \\n \\n The beer is a \"really classic\" West Coast-style India pale ale made with Centennial and Cascade hops, Gregory said. \"If it\\'s going to be raising money to rebuild our community, we felt like it should be a taste of home. We wanted to go with that classic danky west coast IPA ... (that is) fresh, piney, citrusy, hop-heavy, and nice and bright.\" \\n \\n Thank you @ButteSheriff@KoryHonea for helping us brew Resilience Butte County Proud IPA today.

       " ' Sierra Nevada Brewery in Chico is brewing up another way to raise money for victims of the Camp Fire. \\n \\n On Tuesday, Sierra Nevada will begin brewing a special IPA to raise money for fire relief efforts. The beer is called Resilience Butte County Proud IPA \\n \\n The fire hit close to home for the company, with 15 percent of their employees losing homes in the fire. \\n \\n Sierra Nevada Founder Ken Grossman reached out to other small breweries across the country and shared the recipe. \\n \\n As of Tuesday morning, 998 breweries nationwide will be making and releasing the Resilience IPA and donating the proceeds. Sierra Nevada spokesperson Robin Gregory said they now hope to raise more than a million dollars through the fundraiser. \\n \\n \"We were absolutely blown away,\" Gregory said. \"We knew that we would probably get a good response, and were hoping, it would be great if we could get to 500 breweries committing. That was a big kind of pie in the sky goal, now it looks like we\\'re going to have double that number.\" \\n \\n \\n \\n The company\\'s hops and malt suppliers are donating the ingredients to make the beer, and Resilience Brewing Company gave Sierra Nevada permission to use the Resilience name temporarily. \\n \\n Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman has already donated $100,000 dollars to fire victims by establishing the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund supported through the Golden Valley Bank Community Foundation. \\n \\n The IPA will be released around the first of the year.

       " ' November 21, 2018 \\n \\n The Camp Fire–the most devastating wildfire in California’s history–has hit close to home for Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. While the Chico brewery was spared, many of Sierra Nevada’s employees, patrons and neighbors lost everything as the Camp Fire ravaged northern Californian. \\n \\n To help raise much needed support for the recovery efforts, Sierra Nevada has created a beer called Resilience IPA. Sierra Nevada, along with many of its professional brewing peers, will be brewing and selling Resilience IPA with all proceeds donated to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund through Golden Valley Community Bank Foundation. \\n \\n It is our hope that homebrewers will make a batch of Resilience IPA in solidarity with Sierra Nevada and pro breweries across the country. While we can’t sell our creations and donate the proceeds, please consider donating to the Golden Valley Community Bank Foundation if you are able. \\n \\n Are you a professional brewery or homebrew shop that would like to join the cause? Contact Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. \\n \\n This recipe was provided by Sierra Nevada Brewing Company and scaled down from the original by Chip Walton of Chop and Brew. ',\n",
       " ' In early November, the Camp Fire swept across Butte County, California, scorching an area the side of Brooklyn and Queens combined, destroying over 18,000 homes and businesses, and killing 86 people. The fires really hit home for one of America’s largest brewers, Sierra Nevada. Their Chico brewery came within a mere mile of the flames, and many of the brewery’s employees were affected by the fire. \\n \\n Enter the beer industry. \\n \\n Sierra Nevada sent out a “bat signal” days after the fire for help in building out a fundraiser to support the fire’s victims. They worked with hop, malt, and yeast suppliers to donate ingredients and sought breweries across the country to collectively brew the Resilience Butte County Proud IPA. Supplies were sent earlier this month to participating breweries – 1,400 of them in all – to whip up batches of the beer with a simple premise: 100% of the sales go to the Camp Fire Relief Fund. \\n \\n Keep reading ',\n",
       " ' (Packaged in cans by Sierra Nevada, and draught from amazing brewers across the country. Available late December!) \\n \\n When the Camp Fire started in the hills above our Chico brewery on November 8, 2018, it soon became the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. The fire burned more than 153,000 acres, killed at least 85 people, and destroyed more than 13,000 homes. Many of our employees and community members were severely impacted by this tragic event. \\n \\n In the days following the fire, we announced plans to brew Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, a fundraiser beer for Camp Fire relief. We committed to brewing the beer and donating 100% of the sales to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund, aimed at long-term community rebuilding support. And we asked every brewery in the country to do it with us. \\n \\n We sent out the “bat signal” calling our friends in the industry, asking our suppliers to donate ingredients, asking other breweries (our competitors) to donate their time and labor costs, and asking our wholesalers and retailers to carry the beer for free. It was a big ask, and we never could have anticipated the response. \\n \\n More than 1,400 breweries signed up to brew Resilience. Our suppliers donated ingredients to every brewery nationwide. Wholesalers and retailers agreed to carry the beer and donate every dollar they received. All of them agreed to do this for free to benefit people they had never met. \\n \\n In all, Resilience Butte County Proud IPA should hit the market in mid-late December more than 17,000 barrels—or 4.2 million pints—strong. Every dollar Sierra Nevada receives will go to those impacted by the Camp Fire. \\n \\n Thank you to the brewing community. Thank you to our suppliers. Thank you to our wholesalers and retailers. And thank you to every single customer who is helping us rebuild our Butte County community—one pint at a time. \\n \\n Brewers | Malt Suppliers | Hop Suppliers | Wholesalers \\n \\n Resilience Night \\n \\n When: December 20th \\n \\n Where: Your favorite participating brewery \\n \\n Please join us for Resilience Night! On Thursday, December 20, we’ll raise a glass with the 1,400+ breweries around the world brewing Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, our fundraiser beer for Camp Fire relief. Head to your local participating brewery to try their version of Resilience IPA–every dollar spent on Resilience will benefit those impacted by the Camp Fire. Together, we can raise more than $10 million to rebuild Butte County. \\n \\n Untappd \\n \\n We are excited to announce that, starting December 15th, Untappd is participating in the release of Resilience IPA by offering its users a limited edition badge that can be earned by checking in to ANY Resilience IPA FROM ANY of the breweries that are officially participating. Not an Untappd user? Join today! \\n \\n Where to get Resilience!? \\n \\n Cans \\n \\n Resilience IPA is packaged in cans by Sierra Nevada. The beer is starting to ship now. It will take some time for it to get from us, to the wholesalers, to the retailers. The amount of time depends on several factors, but distance is the main determiner. You can use our beer locator to find retailers nationwide that have it. The locator is updated continuously, so check back often. \\n \\n Find Resilience IPA at Retail \\n \\n Draught \\n \\n Resilience IPA is available on draught from more than 1,400 breweries.

       "['For years now, movie theater operators have been trying to dissuade their customers from chatting on cell phones or texting during shows. Some issue stern pre-show warnings that anyone caught texting or talking will be shown the door. \\n \\n It\\'s not surprising then that the new chief executive and president of AMC Theaters, Adam M. Aron, caused a stir by suggesting that nation\\'s second-largest movie theater company would consider the idea of making certain auditoriums \"more texting friendly\" in a bid to get millennials to go to the movies more often. \\n \\n \"When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don\\'t ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow,\" said Aron in an interview with Variety published online Wednesday. \\n \\n \"You can\\'t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That\\'s not how they live,\" said Aron, who hailed from outside the movie business before taking the reins of parent company AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) in January. \\n \\n His suggestion that the company might revisit its stance on texting during shows didn\\'t sit well with many movie buffs, who flooded AMC\\'s social media accounts with objections. Some threatened to take their business elsewhere if AMC followed through with the idea. \\n \\n The company quickly responded to the backlash with the following post: \"Press reports we are considering test allowing texts in a very few screens. We know vast majority of audience wants no texting. If ever, we only would pursue this in a way that we can be totally confident ALL our guests will fully enjoy the movie-going experience at AMC.\" \\n \\n That still wasn\\'t enough to quell critics on Twitter and Facebook. By Friday, AMC retreated with a company statement that included the following tweet: \\n \\n NO TEXTING AT AMC. Won\\'t happen. You spoke. We listened. Quickly, that idea has been sent to the cutting room floor. pic.twitter.com/JR0fo5megR — AMC Theatres (@AMCTheatres) April 15, 2016 \\n \\n Aron, former CEO of Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT), is no doubt mulling new ways for AMC to woo an increasingly distracted and demanding audience. Rather than turn off their smartphones, many millennials would rather skip the theater altogether, or kick back at home and stream movies on their flat-screen TVs or mobile devices, via Netflix (NFLX) and other services. \\n \\n In 2015, America\\'s 18- to 24-year olds represented 10 percent of the U.S. population and bought 14 percent of all movie tickets sold here, down from 16 percent in 2014, according to Stan Meyers, a Piper Jaffray & Co. analyst who covers media and entertainment companies. \\n \\n Teens, somewhat surprisingly, are going to the movies more often these days, as are those in the 60-plus set, as measured by their percentage contributions to overall ticket sales between 2014 and 2015, said Meyers. \\n \\n \"One of the things keeping millennials away from the movies is that they need to be on their phones all the time. What [Adam Aron] wants to do is segregate different groups so that people don\\'t want to be on their phones, i.e., older demographic groups, and those who do could be in different [auditoriums],\" said Meyers. \\n \\n In his first few months as CEO, Aron has taken other steps to ensure that AMC, known as an innovator in the movie business, stays competitive in the face of demographic shifts and rapid technological change. In March, AMC announced that it has struck a deal to acquire Carmike Cinemas (CKEC), a merger that would create the world\\'s largest chain of movie theaters. \\n \\n AMC, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, is also reportedly close to a deal with the Screening Room, a startup that will offer new releases in the home, via a set-top box that transmits movies, for $50 per view, according to Variety. \\n \\n The venture is controversial within the movie business, but Variety reports that the Screening Room, backed by Sean Parker of Facebook (FB) and Napster fame, is seeking to pave its way by sharing its proceeds with distributors and providing customers with two free movie tickets per view, which would help boost concession sales for theater operators. \\n \\n But it\\'s the texting controversy that has put AMC in the hot seat in the eyes of some moviegoers. That is perhaps not surprising given that some people feel so strongly about the etiquette surrounding cell phone use in theaters that the issue has sparked violence. In early 2014 an argument between two men in a theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida, over texting ended in a fatal shooting. Before the argument erupted, the man who was eventually shot was sending text messages to his daughter during the previews to the movie. ',\n",
       " ' CLOSE On Friday the AMC movie theater chain scrapped its tone deaf idea of attracting millennials to its theaters by allowing movie-goers to text while watching films. AMC says the proposal it floated this week has been relegated to the cutting room floor. USA TODAY \\n \\n Texting-friendly screens — coming soon to AMC? (Photo: FREDERIC J. BROWN, AFP/Getty Images) \\n \\n AMC Theatres is changing the script on plans to allow moviegoers to text in the theater. \\n \\n The movie theater chain said Friday it will scrap plans to allow some theater patrons to text during movies, a move its CEO had said it considered to attract more millennials. \\n \\n \"We have heard loud and clear this is a concept our audience does not want,\" said AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron said in a statement. \\n \\n NO TEXTING AT AMC. Won\\'t happen. You spoke. We listened.

       " \" Source: WCMH \\n \\n COLUMBUS (WCMH) — The CEO of AMC Theatres says his company is considering loosening its ban on texting during movies. \\n \\n In an interview with Variety Magazine, AMC CEO Adam Aron said his company is looking for ways to reshape the movie-going experience so that millennials go to movie theaters as often as baby boomers did before them. \\n \\n When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don’t ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow. You can’t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That’s not how they live their life.” \\n \\n Aron told the magazine they need to find a way to do it that doesn’t disturb existing audiences. Options include texting sections in auditoriums or making specific auditoriums more texting friendly. \\n \\n Press reported we considering a test allowing texts in a VERY FEW screens. We know vast majority of audience wants no texting (1 of 2) — Adam Aron (@CEOAdam) April 14, 2016 \\n \\n IF ever, we ONLY would pursue in a way we'd be TOTALLY confident ALL our guests will fully enjoy movie going experience at AMC (2 of 2) — Adam Aron (@CEOAdam) April 14, 2016 \\n \\n Since the article was published Wednesday, Aron has been subjected to social media outrage on the subject. \\n \\n AMC is the second largest theater chain in the country and is poised to become the largest after acquiring Carmike Cinemas. AMC operates five locations in the Columbus area including Lennox Town Center, Easton, Dublin, Grove City and Hilliard. \",\n",
       " \" Adam Aron has been head of AMC Entertainment for less than four months, but in that short time he’s already orchestrated one of the most significant deals in the country’s history. In February, AMC announced that it has an agreement to buy Carmike, propelling it from being the second-biggest exhibitor in the country to the world’s top movie theater chain. \\n \\n Aron has a diverse resume, having been head of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, CEO and co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, chairman and CEO of Vail Resorts and president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line. But in an industry dominated by lifers, he is a newcomer to the exhibition space. \\n \\n That’s giving him a willingness to experiment. He’s pushing to expand AMC’s food options, bolster its loyalty program and market more aggressively. Some moves may ruffle feathers. In a bid to attract younger, smartphone savvy consumers, Aron said he was open to making some theaters texting and mobile device-friendly. \\n \\n That may make him unpopular. When Regal Entertainment CEO Amy Miles mused in 2012 that theaters should consider experimenting with relaxing cellphone bans, the blowback was intense. \\n \\n Related Movie Tickets in London Hit $50 - Here's What They Cost Around the World 'The Terror' Season 2 Adds George Takei as Series Regular, Consultant \\n \\n Aron sat down with Variety during CinemaCon, the annual exhibition trade show unfolding this week in Las Vegas, to discuss the planned merger with Carmike, ticketing advances and Screening Room, the controversial start-up that wants to debut movies in the home the same day they hit theaters. \\n \\n You’ve worked in a number of different industries, but you’re new to exhibition. What perspective do you bring? \\n \\n Coming in fresh, it seems like there’s lots of opportunity to propel revenues or to give consumers better experiences. AMC has been a leader in that regard for a few years now, but I think we will pick up even more of a reputation for that going forward. Already, having been here a couple of months, I know we can step up our marketing activity in a big way. The food that we serve in our theaters can be much more exciting than the current stable of chicken tenders, hot dogs, pizza, in addition to the standard soda and popcorn and candy. A lot of change is possible in this industry for the betterment of our shareholders and our customers. \\n \\n Marketing costs money. Why do you think it’s worth the expense? \\n \\n Next year, assuming the Carmike acquisition is consummated, AMC is going to have in the neighborhood of $4 billion worth of revenue. It’s almost irresponsible for a company with $4 billion worth of revenue on the line not to aggressively market. That’s one of the things that can ensure that the $4 billion comes in, and that’s one of the things that can ensure that more than $4 billion comes in. We wouldn’t be spending for additional marketing if we didn’t think we’d be driving big revenue gains. \\n \\n Are there particular demographics that you plan to target with your marketing? \\n \\n We ought to be looking at three things. People who are already interested in movies and maybe in a big way, where if we up our game, we could get them to come to more movies. That’s one of the reasons to have a better loyalty program with bigger, broader participation, because loyalty programs work. We can convince people who think they are seeing the most movies they can possibly see to go to more movies. \\n \\n The second is market share we can take from our competitors if we market AMC better than they market their theaters. \\n \\n And third, there does seem to be a consensus that there are pockets of consumers who do not see as many movies as other segments of the population and that we can be doing more to attract those people. Millennials come to mind. We need to reshape our product in some concrete ways so that millennials go to movie theaters with the same degree of intensity as baby boomers went to movie theaters throughout their lives. \\n \\n Would appealing to millennials involve allowing texting or cellphone use? \\n \\n Yes. When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don’t ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow. You can’t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That’s not how they live their life. \\n \\n At the same time, though, we’re going to have to figure out a way to do it that doesn’t disturb today’s audiences. There’s a reason there are ads up there saying turn off your phone, because today’s moviegoer doesn’t want somebody sitting next to them texting or having their phone on. \\n \\n Would you have a certain section for texting? \\n \\n That’s one possibility. What may be more likely is we take specific auditoriums and make them more texting friendly. \\n \\n There are reports that you have signed a letter of intent to partner with Screening Room. What is your position on the company? \\n \\n I’m not commenting publicly on Screening Room. I know it’s a topic of hot debate amongst my brethren and sister-en, and I prefer to keep our counsel private right now. Until such time as Screening Room is real, we don’t have to spend a lot of time talking about it publicly. \\n \\n How open are you to different distribution strategies that might modify the theatrical window? \\n \\n For all the talk of the Paramount test a year ago [Editor’s note: AMC signed a deal that allowed the studio to debut two films on home entertainment early] and all the talk of Screening Room now, you may be surprised to hear that I think windows are very important. There’s a lot of evidence that shorter windows put theatrical exhibitors at risk. Studios themselves benefit from posting big global box office numbers, which comes from theatrical distribution. \\n \\n So I start from a general premise that I’m a big fan of windows. Having said that, I’m also a big fan of experimenting and testing on everything that we do to see if there aren’t alternative ways of doing business. I generally look at our 385 theaters as laboratories where we can test lots of different concepts without being afraid that there’s going to be a cataclysmic, sky’s falling in, if we do. I believe in innovation and being imaginative and forward thinking. There are some bedrock principles though. \\n \\n What are those bedrock principles? \\n \\n I have two bedrock principles and only two bedrock principles. One is that it’s our burden as managers of the company that runs movie theaters to make sure that the moviegoing experience is as wonderful and spectacular as it possibly can be. The surest way to grow our business and protect it against erosion is to make sure that going to an AMC theater is a pleasing and memorable experience. \\n \\n The second is the consumer is king. Giving the consumer more choices, more amenities and price points. If we put ourselves in the head of our customer and design our theatrical experience and marketing activity to make their lives better, we’ll have a successful company. Other than that we’ll be flexible and willing to experiment. \\n \\n Where are you in terms of closing the Carmike acquisition? \\n \\n There are really only two hurdles to go through. Carmike’s shareholders have to vote to approve the transaction. I expect that’s going to be some time in June. I don’t think they’ve set a date. \\n \\n We need to get through the Justice Department approval, but we’re optimistic that we will get through both of these hurdles. The contract we have with Carmike requires that we get through this a year from the date of the merger transaction, so early in the first quarter of 2017. It would be nice if we could get it done before that. \\n \\n What does the merger do for AMC? \\n \\n By putting together the No. 2 and No. 4 players in the industry, we create a new No. 1 player. There’s extraordinary amounts of research that say that No. 1 players in industries are often the most successful players in their industries. If that turns out to be true, I’d rather be the No. 1 player than the No. 2 player. \\n \\n Why did you recently sign a deal with ticketing app, Atom Tickets? \\n \\n They’ve got a great social media platform where when you buy a ticket for a Wednesday night at 7:00 show, it sends a text message to all your friends asking if they want to go to the theater and sit next to you. They click a couple of buttons and your friend can buy a ticket at the same theater and showtime in a reserved seat. That’s a great concept and that’s one of the ways that we can make it easier for Millennials — who live on social media — to meet up with their friends in movie theaters. \\n \\n Megan Fox delivered a pizza to your seat during Paramount’s CinemaCon presentation this week. What was that experience like? \\n \\n They took the pizza away as quickly as they delivered it. It was warm, and I could smell it, but we didn’t get to eat it. I can’t tell you how it tasted, but in terms of who and how it was delivered, I can tell you that’s the best pizza delivery I’ve ever had. \",\n",

       " ' AMC Theatres is threatening legal action against MoviePass, a subscription-based service for cinema-goers, hours after the company announced it will allow customers to see a movie a day for less than $10 a month. \\n \\n In a statement, the world’s largest exhibitor dismissed MoviePass as “a small fringe player” and said that its model “is not in the best interest of moviegoers, movie theatres and movie studios.” \\n \\n AMC’s stock has been hit hard in recent weeks after it released disappointing quarterly earnings and lowered its projections for 2017. The summer box office is in a slump and a stream of film flops have dragged down exhibition stocks. Shares of AMC took a beating again on Tuesday following MoviePass’ pricing announcement — the company’s stock ended the day down 2.57% at $13.25. \\n \\n MoviePass didn’t just unveil a new pricing plan on Tuesday. It also announced that had sold a majority stake to Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc., a publicly traded data firm, for an undisclosed price. \\n \\n Since it was founded in 2011, MoviePass has roiled exhibitors, who have engaged in legal action at various points to try to stop its development. \\n \\n Related What Is MoviePass? The Pros and Cons of $10-a-Month Unlimited Films \\n \\n In an interview with Variety, MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe said the deal has yet to close, but expressed concern that AMC’s stance could hurt his business. \\n \\n “I’m not worried about it killing the sale,” he said. “What I’m worried about is it confusing customers and making them believe they can’t use this service at AMC theaters.” \\n \\n MoviePass is using the capital injection from the sale to fund an overhaul to its pricing model. It will now enable customers to see a movie a day in a theater for a $9.95 monthly fee, far less than the cost of a ticket in many major markets. \\n \\n MoviePass re-sells the tickets to customers and purchases them at full price using a MasterCard debit card. It claims it boosts attendance by 111% and that its customers buy more concessions. But exhibitors have preferred to bolster their own loyalty programs instead of aligning themselves with the service. For instance, AMC has invested heavily in growing its Stubs rewards program. \\n \\n In the statement, AMC said it is consulting with its attorneys to determine if or how it can prevent a subscription program offered by MoviePass from being used at its locations. It questioned the longterm viability of MoviePass’ model, noting that the average ticket price for watching a movie at AMC Theatres in the most recent financial quarter was $9.33. \\n \\n “From what we can tell, by definition and absent some other form of other compensation, MoviePass will be losing money on every subscriber seeing two movies or more in a month,” AMC’s statement reads. \\n \\n Lowe acknowledges that his company is subsidizing ticket buyers and will lose money in the process. However, he believes that MoviePass will be able to prove its value to movie theaters and studios, and that in the future they will cut the company in on their additional profits. Theater owners could also either pay MoviePass back with advertising or give them a percentage of the concessions sales. \\n \\n “There must be some way to make us whole,” said Lowe. “We know we have to prove the value we deliver and, at that point in time, where we’re delivering value to studios and theaters, we can work together with them in a constructive manner so that everybody makes more money.” \\n \\n At one point, AMC and MoviePass had worked in concert with each other. In 2015, the companies partnered on a pilot program in select markets. Ironically, MoviePass uses data from that initiative to support its claims that it bolsters concessions sales and attendance. In the ensuing years, AMC has gone from ally to foe. On Tuesday, it was withering in its dismissal of MoviePass’ ambitions. \\n \\n In the statement, it said “that it is not yet known how to turn lead into gold,” adding, “In AMC’s view, that price level is unsustainable and only sets up consumers for ultimate disappointment down the road if or when the product can no longer be fulfilled.” \\n \\n The company said that reducing pricing to accommodate the MoviePass model would negatively impact the customer experience and would leave them unable to “operate quality theaters.” It went on to suggest that the MoviePass model would have a chilling effect on the creative community by cutting them out of the income they receive from movie theaters. \\n \\n “While AMC is not opposed to subscription programs generally, the one envisioned by MoviePass is not one AMC can embrace,” the company’s statement reads. “We are actively working now to determine whether it may be feasible to opt out and not participate in this shaky and unsustainable program.” \\n \\n Lowe, a co-founder of Netflix and the former head of Redbox, compared AMC’s reaction to the blowback those home entertainment companies received from movie studios and video rental chains when they offered DVDs by mail or via kiosks. \\n \\n “This is so much like Blockbuster was when we rolled out Netflix or Redbox,” said Lowe. “It’s the big guy being afraid of the little guy offering better value to consumers.”']"
